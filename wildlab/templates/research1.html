        Wildlife-human dynamics & human dimensions of wildlife 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Human-wildlife-conflicts are a serious threat to wildlife conservation and the livelihoods of people worldwide. The interaction between wildlife and people and the resultant negative impact on man or his resources, or wild animals or their habitat is and are becoming more prevalent as human population increases, development expands, and global climate changes and other environmental factors place people and wildlife in greater direct or indirect competition for dwindling resources. A complex set of factors such as human-driven habitat modification and fragmentation, behavioural ecology of wildlife, human dimensions of wildlife, variability in the climate and resources are the major causes of human-wildlife conflicts. Crop damage by wild animals, cattle-lifting, human casualties, household damage, transmission of diseases, malicious killing of wildlife due to fear and or as revenge are common forms of human-wildlife conflicts. We try to understand these drivers to develop species-specific and site-specific management strategies.
