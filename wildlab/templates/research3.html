        Surveys and population assessment
    </h2>
    <p class="content">
        Status surveys and population assessments play a crucial role in wildlife conservation efforts. They provide essential information on the abundance, distribution, and trends of different species, helping conservationists understand the health of populations and identify potential threats. These surveys enable informed decision-making, allowing for the implementation of targeted conservation strategies, such as habitat protection, species-specific management plans, and measures to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. By regularly conducting status surveys and population assessments, conservationists can monitor the effectiveness of their interventions and make adjustments as needed to ensure the long-term survival of wildlife species.

        <li class="subheading">Wildlife-friendly and organic certification for cash crop plantations of KFDC</li>
        <p class="content">
            The Gavi Division of KFDC, nestled next to the Periyar Tiger Reserve, features a lush and biodiverse landscape. Kerala Forest Development Corporation manages cash crop plantations here, growing cardamom and coffee. This area's rich biodiversity offers the potential for wildlife-friendly and organic products, benefiting local stakeholders. In response to KFDC's request, we conducted a study to potentially certify these plantations as wildlife-friendly and organic. The study unveiled a diverse array of 18 mammal species, 109 bird species, 20 reptiles, 31 amphibians, 58 butterflies, 51 moths, and 29 odonates, highlighting the area's abundant wildlife. We also identified and mapped potential wildlife habitats within the plantations, coexisting seamlessly with natural surroundings. Our assessment indicated minimal human-wildlife conflict, overall healthy wildlife habitats, and no significant threats to the local ecosystem. However, we observed some potential issues including electric fencing, unchecked invasive species, tree collection, roadkills, and an inadequate waste management system, all posing minor threats. Stakeholder perspectives showed a positive local attitude toward wildlife. In summary, the study suggests that KFDC Gavi's plantations exhibit wildlife-friendly characteristics, warranting consideration for certification. We also provide recommendations to address minor human-wildlife conflicts and improve wildlife-friendly practices.
