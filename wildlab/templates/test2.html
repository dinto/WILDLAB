    Human-wildlife-conflicts are a serious threat to wildlife conservation and the livelihoods of people worldwide. In Kerala, being one of the densely populated states with highly fragmented forests, human-wildlife conflict has increased in its intensity and spread over the recent years. It has become a serious social and political issue following few human casualties and large scale crop depredation in certain parts of the state, especially in the forest fringe areas where farmers depend on marginal farming for their livelihood. The anthropocentric approach of dealing with the issue -focusing exclusively on the adverse impact of wildlife on humans- by the media and others leading to attacking the custodians of forests and wildlife, makes the situation worse than ever. Though a few studies have been conducted at local scales by KFRI and other organisations, a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis of wildlife-human interactions in the state and protocols for site and species specific adaptation and mitigation measures are lacking. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the current situation of the human-wildlife conflict in the state, build a comprehensive database of human-wildlife interactions and map the hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts in Kerala, develop site and species specific protocols for the quick response, rescue mechanisms, stakeholder awareness, and capture the attitudes of stakeholders towards the conservation of species involved in conflicts.
