                You know monsoon has truly arrived in Kerala when the nights reverberate with the orchestra of the frogs. Or do you? With habitat destruction and anthropogenic climate change, is the seasonal symphony still as loud?

                In order to keep a tab on the frog population in Kerala, the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) has launched a new initiative aimed at collecting data, identifying and recording as many species as possible. Launched on June 5, the Centre for Citizen Science and Biodiversity Informatics at KFRI’s Monsoon Croaks BioBlitz allows people to record their frog sightings and calls on the iNaturalist app. Monsoon being the mating season and a time when frog activity peaks, this is the right time to watch frogs.

                KOCHI: It’s time to check out the bat roosts near your home! In a unique move, a citizen science initiative is being launched where the local residents are being included into a bat conservation project. All one needs to do is to visit the bat roosting sites, share the details in a form floated by the organisation — you just did your bit to protect the bat species Indian Flying Fox. 
            </p>            
            <p>
                The project is being launched by the Kerala Forest Research Institute’s (KFRI) Department of Wildlife Biology. Titled ‘The Fruit Bat Project’, it is initiated by the Centre for Citizen Science and Biodiversity Informatics in association with the Conservation Leadership Programme and is headed by Dr Balakarishnan P, scientist, Department of Wildlife Biology.

                THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Bats are widely misunderstood creatures, with a significant section of the human race confounded by the mammal. And ‘Sally, the fruit bat’ is here to dispel all kinds of myths surrounding the mammal. Wildlife researcher Nithin Divakar has initiated a project on social media to bring some goodwill to the mammal. An Insta page titled @bat_conservation_kerala has been started by the researcher where fruit bat Sally, a character created for the project, will introduce the ‘bat world’ to the public.
