        Citizen Science, Outreach & Stakeholder Engagement  
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is a growing demand for scientific literacy and desire to democratise science in order to create a knowledge society, which is expected to fundamentally alter the policy-making process. With numerous global issues affecting humanity such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, overpopulation, and emerging diseases, it is crucial to use scientific evidence to develop government policies. Citizen Science, also referred to as participatory science, is a developing approach to enhance scientific endeavours, promote scientific literacy, aid education, and effectively address societal needs by utilising scientific evidence to tackle these challenges.  

    </p>
    <p>
        The synergistic utilisation of big data and disruptive digital tools like artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in revolutionising nature and wildlife conservation. It enables unprecedented insights, predictive modelling, and informed decision-making for effective ecosystem and wildlife management, species protection, and sustainable conservation practices. 
    </p>
    <p>Projects and programmes within this theme are developed against these backgrounds.  </p>
    <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
    <p>At KFRI, we coordinate the Centre for Citizen Science and Biodiversity Informatics, which aims democratisation of science through public participation, networking and capacity building programmes for various stakeholders. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ongoing & recent projects and programmes are: </h2>

        <li>CitSci Clubs: The Citizen Science Club is a unique initiative designed for students to learn about biodiversity, research methodologies, and tools through hands-on experience. As members of the club, you will be encouraged to learn the tools, start your own citizen science projects and make a difference in your local community. Faculty members may

        <li>Biodiversity Internship Programme: The Centre for Citizen Science & Biodiversity Informatics (CCSBI) encourages students to join as interns to 
            participate in citizen science projects throughout India. The programme offers enough learning opportunities including improving the taxonomic skills.To apply

            <b>Wildlife Museum</b> 
        </li>
        <p>Our lab is coordinating the activities of the KFRI-Wildlife Museum, which is a major attraction at KFRI. The specimens and other collections at the museum is used for
            graduate and undergraduate training, species identification workshops and
            educational programs by state and local agencies. Conservation education and training to students and the inservice training to the officials of forests departments across the country are major activities of the museum. See <a href="https://www.kfri.res.in/kfri_museums.asp" target="_blank">instructions</a> for visitors. </p>

            <b>Snake Sense</b>: snake-bite prevention and awareness for the conservation of snake
        </li>
        <p>Direct human killing has been identified as an important cause of population decline in snakes. Majority of such malicious kills of snakes occur in the rural areas because the envenomings and deaths resulting from snake bites are a particularly important public health problem throughout the rural tropics. India tops in the number of deaths due to snakebite in the world with nearly 11,000 estimated deaths annually. The fear and resentment arose from the high mortality rates due to snake-bites resulting from the malicious killing of several non-venomous snakes on sight throughout the region. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to understanding the patterns of the direct killing and impact of such mortality on the natural population of snakes.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Earlier our team was running a citizen science initiative including a public education programme with the aim to understand the patterns of snake kills 
            and to mitigate the malicious killing of non-venomous snakes especially the wolf Snakes which mimic the Common Indian Krait in south India. 
            The present programme <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3YHSngfaos&list=PLe4NZ6vOPQ2DnUisrNC49Vl5FPVyvQFQ_&index=6" target="_blank">SnakeSense</a> aims to reduce the conflicts by imparting knowledge on the venomous species, preventive measures and management of snake bites 
            in Kerala, south India. Apart from improving the public attitude towards the conservation of snakes, we also aim to understand the patterns of snake mortality 
            in the region. As part of this programme, we regularly assess the knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the public towards snakes and conduct workshops 
            to improve knowledge on snakes.

            <b>Bat for bats </b>: awareness on bats and their conservation
        </li>
        <p>Bats are the second most speciose order of mammals. They play a crucial role in the pollination and seed dispersal of several plants of commercial and ecological value, aiding in forest regeneration. Unfortunately, bats are often portrayed as villains in stories and movies, and recent outbreaks of Nipah and Covid-19 have further increased fear and led to habitat destruction for bats. Anthropogenic factors such as habitat loss, deforestation, poaching, meat trade, environmental pollution, wind turbines, climate change, and biological invasions have caused bat populations to decline worldwide. Due to their low reproductive rates, gregarious lifestyles, and high metabolic rates, most bat species cannot withstand anthropogenic pressures. Moreover, we have insufficient knowledge about even the most prevalent bat species, including their population status, microhabitats, and reproductive and living habits. This knowledge gap presents challenges for the government, scientists, and law enforcement in comprehending the threats bats face and implementing appropriate protection measures. Bat for Bats aims to create awareness among students and the general public on the role that bats play in our daily lives and to dispel myths about these flying mammals through awareness programmes and social media.</p>
        <p>Write to us if you are interested in conducting an awareness programme on snakes or bats in your institution (schools, colleges) or other networks (clubs, libraries, residence associations, etc). </p>
        <li><b>Nature Connect</b> is a future programme to explore the potential of disruptive digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence for wildlife and nature conservation. Such tools are key to connect and engage the largely disconnected urban dwellers,  children, veterans, physically and mentally challenged people with nature to create environmental awareness and health benefits; and  to understand health and recreational benefits of nature and wildlife. </li>
        <p>Write to us if you are technologist or educator interested in developing projects / tools using digital technologies for stakeholder engagement and nature conservation. </p>
