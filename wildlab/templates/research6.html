        Citizen Science, Outreach & Stakeholder Engagement  
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is a growing demand for scientific literacy and desire to democratise science in order to create a knowledge society, which is expected to fundamentally alter the policy-making process. With numerous global issues affecting humanity such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, overpopulation, and emerging diseases, it is crucial to use scientific evidence to develop government policies. Citizen Science, also referred to as participatory science, is a developing approach to enhance scientific endeavours, promote scientific literacy, aid education, and effectively address societal needs by utilising scientific evidence to tackle these challenges.  

    </p>
    <p>
        The synergistic utilisation of big data and disruptive digital tools like artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in revolutionising nature and wildlife conservation. It enables unprecedented insights, predictive modelling, and informed decision-making for effective ecosystem and wildlife management, species protection, and sustainable conservation practices. 
    </p>
    <p>Projects and programmes within this theme are developed against these backgrounds.  </p>
    <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
    <p>At KFRI, we coordinate the Centre for Citizen Science and Biodiversity Informatics, which aims democratisation of science through public participation, networking and capacity building programmes for various stakeholders.

        <li>CitSci Clubs: The Citizen Science Club is a unique initiative designed for students to learn about biodiversity, research methodologies, and tools through hands-on experience. As members of the club, you will be encouraged to learn the tools, start your own citizen science projects and make a difference in your local community. Faculty members may
